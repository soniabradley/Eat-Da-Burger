# Built With

* [MVC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mvc_framework/mvc_framework_introduction.htm) The Model-View-Controller separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. 

* [ORM - Object Relationional Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) ORM often reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.  Disadvantages of ORM tools generally stem from the high level of abstraction obscuring what is actually happening in the implementation code. 

* [cb](https://www.google.com/search?q=callback+in+javascript&oq=call+back+in+ja&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.9481j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Call Back - A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing â€” hence the name 'call back'. More complexly put: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions.
